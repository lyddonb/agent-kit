**The books.** The CFO keeps its data in a private git repo, "the books", never in this skill or any public repo. Find it in this order: the `CFO_BOOKS` environment variable, then `~/code/finances`, then ask the user where it is. If there are no books yet, offer to create them with this layout:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `ledger/charges.csv` | One row per charge: `charge_date, period_start, period_end, provider, service, charge_type, billed_cost, currency, api_equivalent_cost, project, status, source, evidence` (FOCUS-style) |
| `projects.yaml` | Which project each provider resource belongs to; new ones are `state: proposed` until confirmed |
| `budgets.yaml` | The monthly envelope and alert rules; `status: proposed` until the user confirms |
| `renewals.yaml` | Upcoming renewals and vendor changes to watch |
| `questions.md` | What the CFO needs from the user, each with a best guess |
| `briefs/` | One brief per weekly run |
| `inbox/` | Files the user drops in (invoice PDFs, statement CSVs); git-ignored |

Rules that always apply:
- Never write card numbers, bank account numbers, cloud account IDs or credentials into the books. Vendors, amounts, dates and receipt or invoice numbers are fine.
- Never pay, cancel, downgrade, delete or contact a vendor. Propose it; the user approves, and the approval goes on record.
- Never guess an amount. Leave `billed_cost` empty with `status: unknown` and add a question with your best guess.
- Append to the ledger; never rewrite a past row. A correction is a new row with `charge_type: adjustment`.
- Keep two numbers apart: **cash cost** (money that left the account) and **API-equivalent cost** (what the tokens would cost at metered API prices). On flat subscriptions they differ a lot; a product built on metered APIs turns the second into the first.
